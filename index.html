<h1>Mobile Medical Devices and Apps</h1>
<h2>COMP 50 / EE 93, Tufts University Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Fall 2014</h2>
</div>

<h3>Catalog Description</h3>
<p>Team-based projects to design, build, and present a working medical device prototype. Devices are constructed using Android, iOS, and Arduino based components, using appropriate software for designated functionality and user-interface requirements.  Project specification with imposed requirements and constraints, sensor/data acquisition, software architecture, hardware integration, working prototype demonstration, final presentation, and project report are course assignments</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>

<p>This course is structured to have the students implement their own design solution to a course challenge to build a mobile medical device.  The device acquires data via sensors, converts the signal to digital form for evaluation and display by the software algorithms. Knowledge and utilization of the engineering method, customer requirements to define scope of work, risk analysis, design specification, test and acceptance plans, oral, written, and working prototype presentations to demonstrate student analysis, design, and team collaboration skills.  Ethics and societal impact as it relates to medical device design is discussed. Guest lecturers from practitioners in the field are expected twice during the semester to discuss relevant topics and related experiences.</p>
<p>This is elective course offered jointly by Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering.  Students are required to prepare project proposals for a course defined project consisting of Arduino and mobile device app, project plans, perform a system engineering analysis, and present a working prototype at the end of the semester</p>
